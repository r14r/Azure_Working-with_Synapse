# Azure Synapse Analytics end-to-end solution
Wide World Importers (WWI) has hundreds of brick and mortar stores and an online store where they sell a variety of products. They would like to:

* Gain business insights using historical, real-time, and predictive analytics using structured and unstructured data sources
*	Enable their IT Team of data engineers and data scientists to bring in and run complex queries over petabytes of structured data with billions of rows and unstructured enterprise operational data
*	Enable business analysts and IT team to share a single source of truth and have a single workspace to collaborate and work with enterprise data and enriched customer data
*	They would like to minimize the number of disparate services they use across ingest, transformation, querying and storage, so that their team of data engineers, data scientists and database administrators can master one tool, and can build shared best practices for development, management and monitoring.
