01/05/2015,11:55,Si_ShaunRyan,@Oli4Twist @mwinkle yeah that's what I mean by how HDInsight looks physically above the clouds Since there are degrees of separation
01/05/2015,11:35,Oli4Twist,@Si_ShaunRyan @mwinkle I would really like to see what the true impact is of having the storage and compute separated.
01/05/2015,11:34,Oli4Twist,"@Si_ShaunRyan @mwinkle I believe that it is, however that means you would have to run those clusters 247 which costs loads."
01/05/2015,11:28,Si_ShaunRyan,@mwinkle @Oli4Twist thought a fundamental premise of hadoop was data distributed physically on compute nodes &amp; move as little as possible

01/05/2014,16:34,bobbeauch,"@mwinkle @jamiet I think having Hue would be analogous to how folks use VS now. To learn, experiment, develop. Then automate in production."

01/05/2014,15:33,mwinkle,@jamiet @allanSQLIS certain hadoop command line tools don't take files from hadoop file system paths and only work locally
01/05/2014,15:34,jamiet,"@mwinkle @allanSQLIS got it, thx Matt. Still on that learning curve."

04/03/2014,17:25,halirob,@mwinkle @SQLServer my cache ssas. All in azure. Might end up caching some stuff in sq azure depending on the best way to query certain data
04/03/2014,17:20,mwinkle,"@halirob @SQLServer very common pattern for heavy lifting in HDInsight, and then move to SSAS/SQL/HBase/Mongo for 'interactive' work."

04/03/2014,17:18,halirob,@mwinkle @SQLServer the only thing that bothers me is that the bi tools for fail to refresh data source views efficiently....
04/03/2014,17:19,halirob,@mwinkle @SQLServer ... So I wrote my own cache that sucks the data from odbc Hdinsight and I point my bi views to it for local dev
04/03/2014,17:19,halirob,"@mwinkle @SQLServer actually one more thing, the Hdinsight emulator is lagging behind the live Hdinsight, which is challenging for dev."

04/03/2014,17:40,benjguin,@mwinkle thanks Matt'. Will do. Maybe being able to have Anaconda deployed in the cluster with PowerShell would help. Ex: SciKit-Learn.
04/03/2014,17:06,mwinkle,"@jdanton then, you can simply use 'from hdinsight' as your datasource in PowerQuery"
04/03/2014,17:58,jdanton,@mwinkle Can you follow for a quick question?
04/03/2014,17:05,mwinkle,"@jdanton in that case, you may want to use new-azurehdinsighthivejobdefinition and specify an output directory (-StatusFolder)"

02/02/2014,10:38,robertsahlin,@andybareweb @mwinkle Have you used oozie in HDInsight to dynamically set parameters (current date) to pig jobs in workflow? Experience?
02/02/2014,01:51,mwinkle,"@robertsahlin one potential work around, param substitution in a file client side, then upload to storage and use the -queryfile parameter"
02/02/2014,08:24,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle @robertsahlin that's my workaround approach
02/02/2014,01:50,mwinkle,"@robertsahlin ok, still trying to bottom out on this, thought there was a way to get it through -arguments, but can't find that out."
02/02/2014,08:04,robertsahlin,@mwinkle i tried arguments too. But it is tricky to get params to work in HDInsight even if you RDP and run the pig console
02/02/2014,08:07,robertsahlin,"@mwinkle in console, I can only pass one parameter using -param key'='value , that doesn't feel like correct syntax"

28/10/2013,15:46,mwinkle,@simonstewart the dashboard is removed on 1.6 and 2.1 and so the link no longer appears in portal.
29/10/2013,09:35,simonstewart,"@mwinkle so, is there stills JavaScript interactive console for HDInsight?"
28/10/2013,03:45,mwinkle,@azurecoder @krist00fer @elastacloud glad to hear
23/10/2013,23:10,mwinkle,"@jasonhorner haven't tested, but if you can run HADOOP jar, you should be able to use it."
23/10/2013,23:11,jasonhorner,@mwinkle ok cool thanks I'll try it out I have a small cluster setup but I'm still learning
23/10/2013,21:40,mwinkle,"@peschkaj @jasonhorner clusters are running hdp 1.3, and we are in a good place from a perf perspective. Let me know if you see issues"
23/10/2013,22:04,jasonhorner,@mwinkle any way to add this: http://t.co/cOQMSKpjMu
23/10/2013,21:24,peschkaj,"@jasonhorner it should be on relatively recent software. Ask @mwinkle for details, too."

18/10/2013,14:52,mwinkle,A guy could get used to waking up in southern California #reallyItsForWork
17/10/2013,21:00,mwinkle,"@BluewaterSQL can you email me the cluster name you used?  Want to debug that a bit.  Also, what error did you encounter?"
17/10/2013,20:59,mwinkle,"@BluewaterSQL powershell is the start, we have more work to do here. (and will do it)"
17/10/2013,20:57,mwinkle,"@BluewaterSQL we may do that in the future, this step was required to move to a secure by default deployment (rdp off by default)"
17/10/2013,16:00,mwinkle,@BluewaterSQL what issues are you seeing with cluster creation?  About 15 hours ago we were pushing an update.
17/10/2013,18:07,BluewaterSQL,@mwinkle between 9pm and 11pm EST while I was prepping for my PASS demo

17/10/2013,15:57,mwinkle,@BluewaterSQL which changes?
17/10/2013,20:00,BluewaterSQL,@mwinkle disabling rdp by default and having to setup a 2nd login for rdp...atleast add the option to the cluster creation process
17/10/2013,20:05,BluewaterSQL,@mwinkle also a powershell centric approach is counter productive..its great for admins less so for everyone else and adds complexity
17/10/2013,20:06,BluewaterSQL,@mwinkle other vendors are going the opposite direction making the platform easier to use and adopt not harder
14/10/2013,03:49,martinabbott,"@mwinkle Hi Matt, email sent over the weekend. Be great if you can help."
14/10/2013,03:23,mwinkle,Well that Boston game just got interesting
13/10/2013,14:24,mwinkle,@simplymanas @amazedsaint nice to see!
13/10/2013,14:21,mwinkle,@robertsahlin @PabloDoval yes we moved to having rdp off by default as we had requests around greater security there

28/08/2013,20:19,mwinkle,"@SirEel you need to specify the container for the default blob account. You can custom create or script. Or, you can always use full path"
28/08/2013,20:17,mwinkle,@cmarkbrod the command line tools are absolutely the best way to do this.

24/08/2013,17:44,mwinkle,@BI_Monkey what did you run into?
25/08/2013,22:46,BI_Monkey,@mwinkle it was the difference in the syntax for map_input_file between local and azure (http:// vs asv://) - messed with a substring

09/08/2013,03:56,mwinkle,"@buckwoody @peschkaj to be precise, the blob fs is not hdinsight specific, it could work with other distros or just straight apache hadoop."
09/08/2013,03:54,peschkaj,"@buckwoody @mwinkle thanks for the info and clarifications, gents!"
09/08/2013,03:52,mwinkle,@buckwoody @peschkaj not quite.  Hdinsight builds on top of hdp.  The layering is important.
09/08/2013,03:51,mwinkle,"@peschkaj @buckwoody so, hdinsight is always hdp + something, the core hadoop bits are identical."
09/08/2013,03:51,mwinkle,"@peschkaj @buckwoody, in the service we wrap it with easy deployment and hosting, for one box, it is a simple developer install"
09/08/2013,03:50,mwinkle,"@peschkaj @buckwoody yes, but I can't find on my phone.  Basically, hdp is the distro of hadoop bits we use in hdinsight."
09/08/2013,03:50,peschkaj,@buckwoody @mwinkle so HDInsight has the snazzy interface and C# support. HDP is Java and stuff.
09/08/2013,03:47,mwinkle,"@peschkaj @buckwoody there is a section on the page you linked, 'hadoop for windows' that points to hdp for 'multi-node deployments'"
09/08/2013,03:48,peschkaj,@mwinkle @buckwoody OIC! Here’s my dumb question of the day - is the difference between HDInsight and HDP detailed somewhere?

02/08/2013,15:52,mwinkle,@andybareweb was that the root cause?
03/08/2013,18:00,andyelastacloud,"@mwinkle no, different issue."
02/08/2013,09:25,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle http://t.co/P9qxZk2BoR
02/08/2013,02:00,mwinkle,@andybareweb the way to diagnose would be to look at the job.xml file and see what files are being packed up.
02/08/2013,01:57,mwinkle,"@andybareweb maybe, if it does that's a bug.  We try to walk the dependency graph to include all required assemblies."
02/08/2013,01:39,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle could that cause problems with packaging?
02/08/2013,01:35,mwinkle,"@andybareweb hmmm.  Not sure what's going on there, but I have a hunch that we're not adding that to be distributed to all the nodes."
02/08/2013,01:39,andyelastacloud,"@mwinkle I realised I have a bit of a weird ref - reducer references .net binary which is a .exe, even tho it's using it as an assemby"
02/08/2013,01:11,mwinkle,@andybareweb got it.  How were you submitting the job to the cluster? (it's possible we're missing picking up that dependency)
02/08/2013,01:13,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle latest nuget package (after fighting w/ net45) and also original 0.0.0.4 on headnode (that's usually v reliable)

02/08/2013,01:02,mwinkle,@andybareweb could you figure out from the logs which dependency wasn't satistifed?
02/08/2013,01:04,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle It was http://t.co/JA1SCMRa5s but coming in from a dependency we injected to the cleanup to put things into a REST based DB
02/08/2013,00:47,mwinkle,@andybareweb did it consistently fail (and / or did it work on a different cluster) ?
02/08/2013,00:48,andyelastacloud,"@mwinkle it worked localled through streaming unit (so I know the code is ok), only tried on 1 cluster but deployed many times all failed"
02/08/2013,00:45,mwinkle,@andybareweb was it a .NET Map/Reduce job?  Or an executable submitted for a streaming job?
02/08/2013,00:47,andyelastacloud,"@mwinkle it was a HadoopJobExecutor invoked job, with the error occurring in the reducerdriver.exe"
02/08/2013,00:36,mwinkle,"@andybareweb 'k... was it a .NET executable, or a java dependency?"
02/08/2013,00:38,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle .NET exe with .NET dependencies - a tree of dependencies that had no more than 5 levels
02/08/2013,00:40,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle I can send the exe but I can't share the data. I think this might be a problem to replicate it :(
02/08/2013,00:32,mwinkle,@andybareweb when/where/how does it fail?  (feel free to shoot me a mail with screenshots/logs/etc)
02/08/2013,00:34,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle i killed the cluster unfortunately :-( It died during reduce when it called a referenced dependency
02/08/2013,00:18,mwinkle,@andybareweb is it installed on headnode and not the datanodes?
02/08/2013,00:19,andyelastacloud,@mwinkle it's a standard console app with all dependencies in the same directory; usually this works
01/08/2013,23:58,mwinkle,@andybareweb what's up?
02/08/2013,00:00,andyelastacloud,"@mwinkle weird one, missing dependency at runtime although the headnode can use it directly"
01/08/2013,21:43,andyelastacloud,Another hadoop failure. Weird one on packaging. I think I need some @mwinkle help!

08/04/2013,17:16,shirleman,@misamae @mwinkle @Instaclustr it is based on Amazon Dynamo; is an OLTP database so doesn't really compare to Hadoop which is OLAP
08/04/2013,17:16,shirleman,"@misamae @mwinkle @Instaclustr Cassandra is a big-table column store, much like HBase but focuses on availability in CAP theorem"
08/04/2013,08:06,misamae,@shirleman @mwinkle @Instaclustr No yet. How does it compare to hadoop and its contrib project HBase?
08/04/2013,08:04,misamae,@wenmingye @mwinkle @BluewaterSQL Thanks for the help. I will try to see if I can build my prototype using compile jar files.
08/04/2013,08:03,misamae,@wenmingye @mwinkle the plan was to compile Mahout code against HDInsight. But when I try to build pom.xml mahout tests fails.
07/04/2013,21:15,shirleman,@misamae @mwinkle have you looked at Cassandra? You can use @Instaclustr for managed Cassandra

05/04/2013,16:03,mwinkle,"@misamae two other questions, do you want to choose what packages get installed (vs just having them)? which is more important for you?"

15/01/2013,02:33,mwinkle,@EJXD2 would you wear a suit daily?  (I think at one point Steve Jobs had a Japanese designer create uniforms for all Apple employees)
15/01/2013,02:37,EJXD2,@mwinkle I find a suit exponentially easier to do daily than a tix w/ top hat and tails.
15/01/2013,02:29,mwinkle,"@EJXD2 I'm not intrinsically opposed to formalwear daily, but work at a place that has no dress code (and employees that embrace that fact)"
15/01/2013,02:31,EJXD2,@mwinkle think this goes beyond dress code though. Top hat and tails 200 times a year plus care of said garments? No thanks
15/01/2013,02:23,mwinkle,@EJXD2 I find a tailcoat surprisingly refreshing to wear.  English day coats with ascots on Fridays are also particularly peppy.
