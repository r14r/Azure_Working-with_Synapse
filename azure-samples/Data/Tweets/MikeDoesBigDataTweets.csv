01/06/2016,20:53,MikeDoesBigData,@SaugetCh @nitin_msft I see... then you need to increase the default timeout as mentioned earlier.
01/06/2016,20:42,MikeDoesBigData,@SaugetCh @nitin_msft Having said that. It would be better if you upload/append your file in blocks to avoid timeouts and handle retries.

20/04/2016,21:44,davidbaldauff,@MikeDoesBigData I wonder if there is a recording somewhere of this presentation: https://t.co/O5ZW7ZyJDP Would be great to see this.
20/04/2016,18:39,MikeDoesBigData,"@chadequate ... Once you generate the dll, upload it into your ADL Storage and then use CREATE ASSEMBLY FROM 'path'."

20/04/2016,18:38,MikeDoesBigData,@chadequate Large assemblies need to be loaded in two steps (I think the VS tool gives you the option when you register assemblies)...(cont)
20/04/2016,18:37,MikeDoesBigData,"@chadequate This means that you probably got errors in user code (Extractor, C# fn). Here is a way to get more info: https://t.co/WQWrk4TyDg"

20/04/2016,02:42,wonbyte,@MikeDoesBigData thanks! I was looking for the VS slider.
20/04/2016,00:26,MikeDoesBigData,@wonbyte You can control the max amount when submitting the job. Otherwise you can somewhat control it by partitioning the data.
20/04/2016,00:31,wonbyte,@MikeDoesBigData how do you set the max amount?

09/04/2016,00:48,wonbyte,Having the creator of USQL @MikeDoesBigData help optimize a query to move 100GB‚Äú1.6 billion rows‚Äù into Azure is pretty damn awesome. #azure
08/04/2016,23:18,MikeDoesBigData,"@DenisReznik Given the amount of time split and join took/are taking: yes. Add your own, fast fns without type mismatch? C# is easier."
08/04/2016,09:09,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData and specify extractors explicitly for non-trivial data formats. And not specify for well-known: CSV, XML, JSON at least."
08/04/2016,01:05,MikeDoesBigData,We published the self-guided version of our #USQL Hands-On-Lab: https://t.co/7czNjGJxMc
07/04/2016,23:22,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik Correct. Execution is different than SQL Server. But you also want to be able to provide automatic growth if the language grows
08/04/2016,09:00,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData so, you suppose that C# will grow faster than T-SQL? :) Very bad new for DB developers :) (ok, well, I expect that)"
07/04/2016,23:20,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik We are allowing other .Net languages already and are looking at other languages as well.
08/04/2016,09:04,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData yes, I know that, and this is really great that you are working on this. Many developers will appreciate that."
07/04/2016,23:19,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik Many people writing C# will want to use C# dev tooling. But providing an 'inscript' way to write C# functions is good fdback.
08/04/2016,09:01,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData many people who write C# willing to use LINQ syntax to query the data rather than writing C#-SQL :)
08/04/2016,09:02,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData I'm not proposing to avoid C#, I'm just saying that mixing C# and SQL is a bad idea."
08/04/2016,09:03,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData well, this is just my vision :) you can ignore this feedback if you want :)"
07/04/2016,08:19,Aschenbrenner,It's always interesting to speak about Spatial Indexing in Switzerland. Who has invented it? Switzerland! /CC @MikeDoesBigData
07/04/2016,08:15,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData instead of importing assembly and writing C# code separately.It will be very nice to use other languages in functions also.
07/04/2016,08:13,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData what can't be implemented in SQL, can be implemented using UDF. Just make it possible to write C# code in CREATE FUNCTION"
07/04/2016,08:12,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData and so other functions can be implemented into SQL natively, rather than taking a syntax of C# and mixing two languages."
07/04/2016,08:10,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData anyway this is just a declaration. Data Lake can execute it under the hood in other way than SQL Server, am I right?"
07/04/2016,00:18,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik using C# equality: You use C# as the expression language to get all the power and extensibility of C#. So you use == to compare
07/04/2016,07:56,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData exactly :) why I should use it in U-SQL? In SQL I want: WHERE Id = 5, in C# (application) I want: .Where(x =&gt; c.Id == 5)"
07/04/2016,08:00,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData If this is X-SQL, I expect more sequel than C# if you name it U-SQL."
07/04/2016,00:17,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik T-SQL has a very limited set of built-ins. How long did it take SQL Svr to add .Split? And don't get me started on DATE fns ;)
07/04/2016,08:08,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData seems that SELECT * FROM STRING_SPLIT('1,2,3',',') is very fast :)"
06/04/2016,23:53,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik Re need for explicit mention of extractors: many of the data formats are complex enough that a single extractor does not work.
08/04/2016,09:06,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData many of data formats are CSV :) so, maybe we can use default extractors for well-known types, like CSV?"
06/04/2016,22:30,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData but mixing them together doesn't look like a good idea for me.
06/04/2016,22:28,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData from C# code in my application I would love using driver which will give a linq syntax and full power of C#.
06/04/2016,22:27,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData So, I mean that declaratively get data from the Data Lake will be more natural using SQL syntax."
06/04/2016,22:26,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData .Split() .Substring() and other operations can be done using SQL functions and this will look more naturally in a query.
06/04/2016,22:20,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData WHERE Region == 'en-gb'; I can do this with SQL, why I need C# equality operator herei? I just want to get filtered data."
06/04/2016,22:18,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData extension will always correspond to a particular extractor. A convention will make syntax closer to SQL and more beautiful.
06/04/2016,22:17,DenisReznik,@MikeDoesBigData Why we need this syntax? FROM '.../SearchLog.tsv'     USING Extractors.Tsv();
06/04/2016,22:15,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData ok, I have just opened MS tutorial - https://t.co/GY5niCcCIm and have a lot of concerns about U-SQL"
06/04/2016,22:12,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder :). no - U is for unifying or a ref to U-Boot to explore depth of the data lake
06/04/2016,22:34,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData yes, I'm just kidding :) I was on your session on the PASS Summit. I would love to extend power of T-SQL, but not this way."
06/04/2016,22:36,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData good way for me will be functions. developers can write them in different languages, and this will not mess SQL."
06/04/2016,22:10,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik What SQL queries would you like to see in #USQL that you cannot do now? Feel free to add them at https://t.co/lbwJJ0WFfo
06/04/2016,22:14,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData no no, I mean that I don't like to see a lot of things that exist in U-SQL today :) don't need more features now."
06/04/2016,16:27,MikeDoesBigData,@DenisReznik What makes you think so?
06/04/2016,22:07,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData and I'm not a hater of C#, I love it and I have a strong development background with C#. But I love SQL for querying data."
06/04/2016,22:09,DenisReznik,"@MikeDoesBigData it is ugly :) (I hope U is not for ugly anyway). Extending SQL is a good idea, but messing it with C# is bad idea."

06/11/2015,01:49,OliverAsmus,@jamie_dixon @MikeDoesBigData That would make sense too
06/11/2015,01:21,MikeDoesBigData,@jamie_dixon @OliverAsmus I can neither confirm nor deny that it stands for 'being next after T' or for U- as in U-Boot (sub to dive in ADL)
06/11/2015,00:51,isaac_abraham,@MikeDoesBigData @OliverAsmus in fact having worked with both for years i'd go as far as to say i'm not sure when C# is a better fit period

25/08/2011,23:04,MikeDoesBigData,@mschireson .... Relational database systems can scale. See for example http://t.co/wIsR4zL. Interested to hear your thoughts. #NoSQLNow
