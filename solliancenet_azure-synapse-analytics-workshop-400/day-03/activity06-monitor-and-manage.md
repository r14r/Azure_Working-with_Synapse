# Activity 06: Monitor & Manage

## Audience Poll 1

Q: You want to use a UI to review the assigned workload group and importance for a running SQL query. Which option should you use (pick only one)?

A) Log Analytics

B) Monitoring Hub SQL requests

C) Query the `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` DMV

A: Answer (B) is correct. You can monitor active SQL requests using the SQL requests area of the Monitor Hub. This includes details like the pool, submitter, duration, queued duration, workload group assigned, importance and the request content. While you are able to monitor using the DMV, this does not provide the UI as was requested by the question.

## Audience Poll 2

Q: What information is NOT provided when querying the `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` DMV (pick only one)?

A) Count of sessions by user

B) Queued, active or complete queries

C) Query command text

A: Answer (A) is correct. You should query `sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions` to list open and closed sessions, and retrieve the count of sessions by user. The other items ARE information provided in the results of `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests`.

## Audience Poll 3

Q: which of these can you not monitor directly from the Monitor hub (pick only one)?

A) Pipeline Runs

B) SQL request

C) Notebook executions

A: Answer (C) is correct. The Monitor Hub allows you to examine the status of running notebooks *indirectly* by examining Spark applications. There is a one to one relationship between a notebook being run by a given user and a Spark application. The Spark application reflects the Spark session being used by the notebook.

## Audience Poll 4

Q: How do users release Spark resources used by their notebook (pick only one)?

A) Stop any cells running in the notebook

B) Publish the notebook

C) Close the notebook in Studio

A: Answer (C) is correct. To release resources reserved for a Spark Session within a Spark Application, users should close the notebook. This will effectively terminate the Spark application and release Spark pool resources. Stopping cells from running does not free up any resources.

## Audience Poll 5

Q: Which of the following requests will have the highest priority in executing (pick only one)?

A) A user with high importance

B) A role with high importance

C) A role with a resource class of `largerc`

A: Answer (A) is correct. Database user classification takes precedence over role membership classification. When multiple classes might be applicable to a user, user is given highest resource class assignment. Higher importance requests will always run before requests with lower importance. Under the same importance, Azure Synapse Analytics optimizes for throughput. When mixed size requests (such as smallrc or mediumrc) are queued, Synapse will choose the earliest arriving request that fits within the available resources.

## Audience Poll 6

Q: The customer is claiming that they are running multiple requests in a single session, but getting different classification results, is this possible (pick only one)?

A) Yes

B) No

A: Answer (A) is correct. Classification is evaluated on a per request basis. Multiple requests in a single session can be classified differently.

## Audience Poll 7

Q: The customer is observing that critical requests that involve a high degree of locking scheduled first are being pre-emptied by other query requests. How can the fix this (pick only one)?

A) It cannot be controlled

B) Assign the query requests to a user with normal importance

C) Assign the locking requests to a user with above_normal or high importance

A: Answer (C) is correct. By default Azure Synapse Analytics optimizes for throughput, so even though a higher locking need request might be scheduled first, other requests with lower locking needs may bypass it. Workload importance can be used to ensure the order, such that requests with high locking needs occur first by assigning those requests higher importance than other requests. Higher importance requests will always run before requests with lower importance.

## Discussion Points

| Topic | Discussion Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Monitoring - SQL | You can monitor active SQL requests using the SQL requests area of the Monitor Hub. This includes details like the pool, submitter, duration, queued duration, workload group assigned, importance and the request content. |
| Monitoring SQL - Using DMVs | Query `sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions` to list open and closed sessions, and retrieve the count of sessions by user. Query `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` to retrieve query details like listing all queued, active or complete queries, finding the longest running queries and viewing the query command text. Query `sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_performance_counters` for performance counters including memory and CPU utilization. Query `sys.dm_pdw_waits` to see which resources a request is waiting for and `sys.dm_pdw_resource_waits` to see wait information for a given query like the number of concurrency slots used and resource class assigned. Use `sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats` for historic trends analysis of waits.|
| Monitoring - Pipeline Runs | You can monitor pipeline runs using the Monitor Hub and selecting Pipeline runs. Here you can filter pipeline runs and drill in to view the activity runs associated with the pipeline run and monitor the running of in-progress pipelines.
| Monitoring - Spark applications | You can monitor the execution Spark applications representing the execution of notebooks and jobs within the Monitor Hub, selecting Spark applications. Selecting a Spark application to view its progress and to launch the Spark UI to examine a running Spark job and stage details, or the Spark history server to examine a completed application. |
| Workload Classification - Load and query classification and subclassification | Loads (insert, update, delete), Query (Select). Sub classes of loads such as Data Pipeline Loads and Transformations. Sub classes of queries like ad-hoc queries, dashboard queries, cube refreshes | 
| Workload Classification - Importance | Different importance levels assigned to workload classifications, five point scale low, below_normal, normal, above_normal, high. Requests not assigned explicit importance default to normal. Concurrent requests having same importance level are scheduled just like any other requests would be without workload classification. |
| Workload Classification - Unclassified statements | DBCC commands, BEGIN, COMMIT and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION are not classified |
| Workload Classification - Approaches | Use sp_addrolemember to map login to resource class OR use CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER to assign both importance and resource class to requests |
| Workload Classification - Evaluation | Classification is evaluated on a per request basis. Multiple requests in a single session can be classified differently. |
| Workload Classification - Precedence | Database user classification takes precedence over role membership classification. When multiple classes might be applicable to a user, user is given highest resource class assignment. |
| Workload Classification - System classifiers | The pre-defined databases roles that implement resource classes (e.g.  smallrc, mediumrc, staticrc10, staticrc80) map by default to the `normal` importance level |
| Workload Classification - Mixing resource class assignments with classifiers | It is not a best practice to mix resource class role mappings with workload classifiers as this may create confusion and yield seemingly unexpected results. You should drop the existing resource class mappings and instead use just workload classifiers. |
| Workload Importance - Impact on Locking | By default Azure Synapse Analytics optimizes for throughput, so even though a higher locking need request might be scheduled first, other requests with lower locking needs may bypass it. Workload importance can be used to ensure the order, such that requests with high locking needs occur first by assigning those requests higher importance than other requests. Higher importance requests will always run before requests with lower importance.  |
| Workload Importance - Impact on concurrent requests with different resource classes | Under the same importance, Azure Synapse Analytics optimizes for throughput. When mixed size requests (such as smallrc or mediumrc) are queued, Synapse will choose the earliest arriving request that fits within the available resources. If workload importance is applied, the highest importance request is scheduled next. |
| Workload Importance - Monitoring assignment of importance to requests | Use `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` dynamic management view and examine the `importance` column. |
| Concurrency | To ensure each query has enough resources to execute efficiently, Azure Synapse Analytics tracks resource utilization by assigning concurrency slots to each query. The system puts queries into a queue based on importance and concurrency slots. Queries wait in the queue until enough concurrency slots are available. Importance and concurrency slots determine CPU prioritization. |
