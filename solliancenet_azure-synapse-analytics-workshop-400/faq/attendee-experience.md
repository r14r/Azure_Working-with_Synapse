# Attendee Experience FAQ

### **Q**: _I'm on a Mac. Can I access the whiteboard?_

### **Q**: _The performance of Azure Synapse looks terrible. Things are prolonged. The instruction says 2 min execution, but my runs are over 9 min! This is slowing down the progress with the labs! ADF operations on large files are timing out and can't continue!_

**A**: If you are executing your lab and experiencing challenges in any resource execution for the exercises or tasks, please note that during these Covid19 times, Azure capacity is optimized for our customer's end workloads. We realize that this may impact a bit of our performance today as some resources have had to be distributed across regions and DW resource types. Please note that our primary goal is NOT negatively to impact our customers, and we appreciate your patience during this training if we do face some performance challenges. 

If you come across performance challenges, please note this in the "Need help - Ask here" so we can keep track accordingly.

### **Q**: _I don't see Azure Synapse Analytics Preview in my subscription._

**A**: The labs do not require your subscription. We have specially whitelisted preview functionality on our lab subscription while we are still in private preview. Stay tuned on public preview release timing and access updates through our global communities (ex: WW Data & AI CSAs) as more information is released throughout the month.
